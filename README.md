A super minimal starter project that has no opinions on how you do CSS, state management, testing, or data fetching. Its only position is prettier, react-router, webpack, react-hot-loader v4, and of course TypeScript.

## Usage
1. `npm install` to install 3rd party dependencies
1. `npm start` to start the webpack dev server
1. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the sample
